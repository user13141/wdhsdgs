            Thomas Edison was an American inventor and businessman who is regarded as one of the country's most influential businesspeople and inventors. Edison came from humble beginnings to become a famous technological inventor, creating the first commercially functional electric light bulb
a light bulb that is incandescent. Today, he is recognized with assisting in the construction of America's infrastructure.
During the Industrial Revolution, the economy was booming.

           Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, on February 11, 1847.
            He was the youngest of Samuel and Nancy Edison's seven children.
             His father was a political leader from Canada who had been banished,
              and his mother was a gifted teacher who had a significant effect on Edison's early life. Edison had hearing problems in both ears as a youngster due to scarlet fever and ear infections, and he was practically deaf as an adult. Edison would subsequently claim, with variations on the narrative, that he lost his hearing owing to an injury to his ears sustained in a train accident. Others, on the other hand, have dismissed this as the only reason of his hearing loss.
               Edison's family relocated to Port Huron in 1854.He spent a total of 12 weeks at public school in Michigan. His instructor labeled him "difficult" because he was a hyperactive youngster who was often distracted.His mother promptly took him out of school and began tutoring him at home. He had a strong hunger for information when he was 11 years old, devouring books on a wide range of topics. Edison devised a technique for self-education and autonomous learning in this wide-open curriculum that he would use for the rest of his life.Edison persuaded his parents to let him sell newspapers to travelers on the Grand Trunk Railroad line when he was 12 years old. Edison began producing his own tiny newspaper, the Grand Trunk Herald, using his access to the daily news bulletins typed to the station office. Passengers flocked to the up-to-date articles. 
               This was the first of many business enterprises in which he identified a need and seized on the opportunity.Edison also utilized his railroad connections to set up a modest laboratory in a railway baggage compartment to conduct chemical experiments. A chemical fire erupted during one of his tests, and the automobile caught fire. 
               The conductor rushed in and smacked Edison on the side of the head, causing him to lose some hearing. He was compelled to sell his newspapers at numerous stops along the trip after being thrown off the train.

            The Telegrapher, Edison while working for the railroad, Edison had a near-tragic situation that turned out to be lucky. The thankful father of a three-year-old that Edison saved from being run over by an errant train repaid him by teaching him how to operate a telegraph. He had learnt enough to work as a telegraph operator by the age of 15. Edison worked as an itinerant telegrapher throughout the Midwest for the following five years, filling up for those who had gone to the Civil War. He spent his free time reading widely, studying and experimenting with telegraph technology, and learning about electrical science. Edison traveled to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1866, when he was 19 years old, to work for The Associated Press. He was able to spend the most of his time reading and exploring because he worked the night shift.  He developed a free-thinking and inquisitive mindset, demonstrating things to himself via objective analysis and experimentation. Edison excelled at his telegraph work at first because early Morse code was written on a sheet of paper, thus his partial deafness was not a hindrance. However, as technology progressed, receivers became more and more outfitted with a sounding key, allowing telegraphers to "read" messages by listening to the clicks. Edison was disadvantaged as a result, with fewer and fewer job options. When Edison went home in 1868, he discovered that his beloved mother was suffering from mental illness and that his father had lost his job. The family was on the verge of starvation. Edison knew he had to take charge of his own destiny. He went to Boston on the advice of a friend and got a job with the Western Union Company. Boston was America's hub for science and culture at the time, and Edison relished it. He created and patented an electronic voting recorder for swiftly counting votes in the legislature in his leisure time.
